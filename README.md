# Winforms ColorPicker
Was bored so I made this, feel free to use it and modify.
It's just a couple of gradient panels and picture boxes. <br> This can be used but it's more or less a proof of concept. I might make it into an actual control but I'm not too certain but feel free to star the repo! :)
